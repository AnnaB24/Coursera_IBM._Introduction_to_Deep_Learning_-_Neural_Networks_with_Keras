## Artificial Neural Networks
In this module, you will learn about the gradient descent algorithm and how variables are optimized with respect to a defined function. You will also learn about backpropagation and how neural networks learn and update their weights and biases. Futhermore, you will learn about the vanishing gradient problem. Finally, you will learn about activation functions.
